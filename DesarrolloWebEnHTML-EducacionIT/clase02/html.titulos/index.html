    <h1>Bitcoin </h1>

    <p>Bitcoin (abbreviation: BTC; sign: ₿) is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Nodes in the peer-to-peer bitcoin network verify transactions through cryptography and record them in a public distributed ledger,</p> <p> called a blockchain, without central oversight. Consensus between nodes is achieved using a computationally intensive process based on proof of work, called mining,</p>

    <p>Based on a free market ideology, bitcoin was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an unknown person.[6] Use of bitcoin as a currency began in 2009,[7] with the release of its open-source implementation.[8]:ch. 1 In 2021, El Salvador adopted it as legal tender.[4] Bitcoin is currently used more as a store of value and less as a medium of exchange or unit of account. It is mostly seen as an investment and has been described by many scholars as an economic bubble.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>Before bitcoin, several digital cash technologies were released, starting with David Chaum's ecash in the 1980s.[11] The idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first proposed by cryptographers Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992.[11] The concept was independently rediscovered by Adam Back who developed Hashcash, a proof-of-work scheme for spam control in 1997.[11] The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity-based cryptocurrencies came from cypherpunks Wei Dai (b-money) and Nick Szabo (bit gold) in 1998.</p>

    <h3>2008–2009: Creation</h3>

    <p>The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August 2008.[14] On 31 October 2008, a link to a white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list.[15] Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.[7] Nakamoto's identity remains unknown.</p>

    <h3>2010–2012: Early growth</h3>

    <p>Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins[20] before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <h3>Units and divisibility</h3>

    <p>The unit of account of the bitcoin system is the bitcoin. It is most commonly represented with the symbol ₿[1] and the currency code BTC. However, the BTC code does not conform to ISO 4217 as BT is the country code of Bhutan,[54] and ISO 4217 requires the first letter used in global commodities to be 'X'.[54] XBT, a code that conforms to ISO 4217 though not officially part of it,[54] is used by Bloomberg L.P.</p>
